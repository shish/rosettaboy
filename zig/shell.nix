	# Things that didn't work:
	# - Directly using the Zig package, pinned to any version. Nix is "known as the most up to date distribution", but this project uses a *nightly* build of Zig, so that's not there.
	# - Building Zig from source. The latest version of Zig itself uses LLVM+Clang 15, which is brand new and also not yet in Nix repos. There was a brief window in late August 2022 where Zig could be built with LLVM 14, but the most recent commit that works with that doesn't work with this project.
	# - Building LLVM 15 from source. I didn't even try this given the massive disk space and build time requirements.

		# Apparently, Nix capitalizing "SDL2" creates an incompatibility:

		# I'm not sure what the "right" way to do it is. `zig build` seems to just be running `lld -lsdl2`, the SDL2 `.so` files are also capitalized as "libSDL2" on my non-Nix system, and GH:andrewrk/sdl-zig-demo does `exe.linkSystemLibrary("SDL2")` capitalized, so I'm inclined to call this a bug in GH:MasterQ32/SDL.zig for trying to link to non-existent lower-case "sdl2". But then presumably it works in the Docker, so IDK.
